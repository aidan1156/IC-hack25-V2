{"questions": [{"question": "According to the axioms of probability, if E1 and E2 are mutually exclusive events in a \u03c3-algebra F, what is the probability of their union P(E1 \u222a E2)?", "correct_answer": "For mutually exclusive events, P(E1 \u222a E2) = P(E1) + P(E2). This follows directly from Axiom 3 of probability which states that for mutually exclusive events, the probability of their union equals the sum of their individual probabilities.", "difficulty": 2}]}
